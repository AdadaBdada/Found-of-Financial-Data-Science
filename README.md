## [Assignment_1](https://github.com/AdadaBdada/Found-of-Financial-Data-Science/tree/master/Assignment_1)<a name="Assignment_1"></a>

**1. Explore realdirect.com thinking about how buyers and sellers would navigate, and how the website is organized.**
Use the datasets provided for Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.
> - Load in and clean the data.
> - Conduct exploratory data analysis in order to find out where there are outliers or missing values, decide how to handle the them
> - Conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize and make comparisons for residential building category classes across boroughs and across time Use histograms, boxplots, scatterplots or other visual graphs. Provide summary statistics along with  conclusions.

**2. Conducting a CTR analysis using data from The New York Time**
The datasets provided nyt1.csv, nyt2.csv, and nyt3.csv represents three (simulated) days of ads shown and clicks recorded on _the New York Times homepage_. Each row represents a single user. There are 5 columns: age, gender (0=female, 1=male), number impressions, number clicks, and logged-in. Use R to handle this data. 

> - Create a new variable, age_group
> -  For each day:
>    - Plot the distribution of number of impressions and click-through-rate (CTR = #clicks / #impressions) for these age categories
>    - Define a new variable to segment or categorize users based on their click behavior.
>    - Explore the data and make visual and quantitative comparisons across user segments/demographics
>    - Extend analysis across days. Visualize some metrics and distributions over time.

Use the Race Results 1999-2012 link (http://cherryblossom.org/aboutus/results_list.php ) to extract the Race Results for Order of Finish – Women for a couple of years. 
> - Box Plot of Age by Year for Female Runners
> - Scatter Plot for Run Times vs. Age for Female Runners
> - Fit Models to Average Performance
> - Side-by-Side Boxplots of Female Runners’ Run Time vs. Age
> - Residual Plot from Fitting a Simple Linear Model of Performance to Age
> - Piecewise Linear and Loess Curves Fitted to Run Time vs. Age
> - Line Plot of the Number of Female Runners by Year
> - Density Curves for the Age of Female Runners for 2 years (smallest and largest year that
you analyzed)
> - Loess Curves Fit to Performance for 2 years (smallest and largest year that you
analyzed) Female Runners
> - Difference between Loess Curves of the predicted run time for 2 years (smallest and
largest year that you analyzed)
> - Compare the results of the performance of the male runners (previously analyzed in
class) and female runners for the yearly data that you selected to analyze
