## [Assignment_1](https://github.com/AdadaBdada/Found-of-Financial-Data-Science/tree/master/Assignment_1)<a name="Assignment_1"></a>

**1. Explore realdirect.com thinking about how buyers and sellers would navigate, and how the website is organized.**
Use the datasets provided for Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.
> - Load in and clean the data.
> - Conduct exploratory data analysis in order to find out where there are outliers or missing values, decide how to handle the them
> - Conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize and make comparisons for residential building category classes across boroughs and across time Use histograms, boxplots, scatterplots or other visual graphs. Provide summary statistics along with  conclusions.

**2. Conducting a CTR analysis using data from **The New York Time**
The datasets provided nyt1.csv, nyt2.csv, and nyt3.csv represents three (simulated) days of ads shown and clicks recorded on _the New York Times homepage_. Each row represents a single user. There are 5 columns: age, gender (0=female, 1=male), number impressions, number clicks, and logged-in. Use R to handle this data. 

> - Create a new variable, age_group
> -  For each day:
>    - Plot the distribution of number of impressions and click-through-rate (CTR = #clicks / #impressions) for these age categories
>    - Define a new variable to segment or categorize users based on their click behavior.
>    - Explore the data and make visual and quantitative comparisons across user segments/demographics
>    - Extend analysis across days. Visualize some metrics and distributions over time.
