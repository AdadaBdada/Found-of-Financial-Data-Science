The repo is for the Found of Financial Data Science. The homework includes the following aspects using R.

- Data Preparation
- Data and Web Technologies (including access financial data through different APIs)
- Similarity and Distance()
- Trading Strategy and Simulation
- Classification Methods using R
- Tree-Based Methods & Clustering
- Mining Text Data (Using Statistics to Identify Spam)
- Outlier Detection

[Assignment 1] (https://github.com/AdadaBdada/Found-of-Financial-Data-Science/tree/master/Assignment_1)

1. Explore realdirect.com thinking about how buyers and sellers would navigate, and how the website is organized. Use the datasets provided for Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.
> - Load in and clean the data.
> - Conduct exploratory data analysis in order to find out where there are outliers or missing values, decide how to handle the them
> - Conduct exploratory data analysis to visualize and make comparisons for residential building category classes across boroughs and across time Use histograms, boxplots, scatterplots or other visual graphs. Provide summary statistics along with  conclusions.


2. The datasets provided nyt1.csv, nyt2.csv, and nyt3.csv represents three (simulated) days of ads shown and clicks recorded on _the New York Times homepage_. Each row represents a single user. There are 5 columns: age, gender (0=female, 1=male), number impressions, number clicks, and logged-in. Use R to handle this data. Perform some exploratory data analysis:
> - Create a new variable, age_group, that categorizes users as “<20”, “20-29”, “30-39”, “40-49”, “50-59”, “60-69”, and “70+”.
> -  For each day:
>    - Plot the distribution of number of impressions and click-through-rate (CTR = #clicks / #impressions) for these age categories
>    - Define a new variable to segment or categorize users based on their click behavior.
>    - Explore the data and make visual and quantitative comparisons across user segments/demographics (<20-year-old males versus <20-year-old females or logged-in versus not, for example).
>    - Extend your analysis across days. Visualize some metrics and distributions over time.
